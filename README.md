We aim to provide voluntary, professional and essentially confidential care and support to the depressed & the suicidal.

Every 40 seconds someone dies due to suicide and many more attempt suicide – it can happen to anyone anywhere in the world. However, suicides are preventable and everyone can play a role. This can be a family member, friend or colleague who listens closely or encourages help seeking, a health worker who openly asks about suicidal thoughts or previous attempts, the app identifies people at risk and provides support. It can also be a policy maker who takes leadership and brings different stakeholders together. AASRA Suicide Prevention(91-22-27546669 (24x7)), India, along with WHO’s first World Suicide Report, as part of the World Suicide Prevention Day initiative, calls upon individuals, communities and countries to act now for preventing suicide.
